On 14/03/2023, I changed the below settings in BIOS:
  - Fast Boot: Enabled -> Disabled.
  - Secure Boot: Enabled -> Disabled.
  - CFG Lock: Enabled -> Disabled.

The current settings of BIOS:
  - Fast Boot: Disabled
  - MSI Fast Boot: Disabled
  - Secure Boot: Disabled
  - Serial/COM Port: Not found in Settings -> Advanced -> Integrated Peripherals
  - Parallel Port: Like as right above
  - Intel VT-d Tech: Enabled
  - BIOS CSM/UEFI Mode: UEFI
  - Thunderbolt: Disabled
  - Intel SGX: Not found. Probably in MSI laptop, not in desktops.
  - Intel Platform Trust: Enabled (OpenCore suggested to disable. However, I wanted to keep it enabled because of Windows 11. But if Hackintosh crashes, I will disable it)
  - CFG Lock: Disabled
  
  - Intel Virtualization Tech: Enabled
  - Re-Size Bar Support: Enabled
  - Hyper-Threading: Enabled
  - NX Bit (Execute Disable Bit): Yes (locked)
  - XHCI Hand-off: Enabled
  - Integrated Graphics Shared Memory: 64M (default)
  - SATA Mode: RAID0 (I will not set to AHCI Mode)

Where to look for these variables in MSI Mortar B660M DDR4 BIOS (version 11/10/2022)?
